After amending the template structure of website, it is much 
more responsive and the design is consistent on various devices.

I do intend on changing the colour theme of the website so it
is more professional and stands out.

A good idea for a header design is to give it a neon light styling 
(header & titles could be neon with a city backdrop)

Header:
- Fix side navbar so it's responsive and doesn't interfere with home headers []
- Highlight side navbar links when you are on a new section []
- Look into implementing city-esque styling to website []

Projects:
- Make text more easier on eyes to read []

Extra:
- Make paragraph and header text bigger on smaller devices []
- For aesthetic purposes, make bottom of each section cut off by a diaganol line []
- For scalabe purposes, create CSS variables for particular colours & sizes easily []
- Add animated hover effect for buttons []
- Refactor jQuery code in app.js into vanilla JavaScript []
- Fix Netlify deployment (failing this deploy to Vercel) []
