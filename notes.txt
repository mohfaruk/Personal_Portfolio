Portfolio Tickets
After amending the template structure of website, it is much 
more responsive and the design is consistent on various devices.

I do intend on changing the colour theme of the website so it
is more professional and stands out.

Header:
- Navbar text should be larger [x]
- Make header text larger [x]
- Add link button to CV []
- Background and website theme should be navy & white aesthetic []

About:
- Seperate about me text and skills, so skills is beneath about me []
- Add icons under each skill much like original portfolio version []


Projects:
- Have projects alongside each other []
- Projects image should be squared much like original []
- Make text more easier on eyes to read []

Contact:
- Add contact form that links to my email and with captcha to prevent bots []

Extra:
- For aesthetic purposes, make bottom of each section cut off by a diagnol line []
- For scalabe purposes, create CSS variables for particular colours & sizes easily []
- Refactor jQuery code in app.js into vanilla JavaScript []
