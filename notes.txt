After amending the template structure of website, it is much 
more responsive and the design is consistent on various devices.

I do intend on changing the colour theme of the website so it
is more professional and stands out.

Header:
- Include sticky navbar on side using Fab icons (appears when scrolling) []
- Include animated arrow button at bottom of header []
- Include Socials Fab icons under name title [x]

Sections:
- Add underline styling for each section title []

Projects:
- Make text more easier on eyes to read []

Extra:
- For aesthetic purposes, make bottom of each section cut off by a diaganol line []
- For scalabe purposes, create CSS variables for particular colours & sizes easily []
- Add animated hover effect for buttons []
- Refactor jQuery code in app.js into vanilla JavaScript []
